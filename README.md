⚡ Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

This Tableau project analyzes the electric vehicle (EV) landscape in the United States using comprehensive registration and performance data. The dashboard provides insights into the growth, distribution, and key trends of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), supporting decision-making for policy makers, manufacturers, and consumers.

🎯 Objectives
Assess total EV distribution across years, states, makes, and models.
Compare BEVs vs PHEVs in terms of market share.
Understand average electric range across vehicle types.
Explore CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility.
Identify top EV manufacturers and most popular models.
